# LogaShop (monorepo)

- **Web** (Next.js): `apps/web` — dev on port **7777**
- **Mobile** (Expo): `apps/mobile` — scaffold with Expo when ready

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:web      # Web only
npm run dev:mobile   # Mobile only (after Expo app is created)
npm run dev:all      # Both
```

See `apps/web/docs/logashop-expo-monorepo-dev-setup.md` for full setup (Windows, Expo Go, LAN API URL).
